# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends.
## Overview of Project
Analyzing kickstarter data to find trends within. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use the data provided to find trends which will help in finding how various projects perform in relation to time of launch and how much they an raise from that given time. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The data was able to be organized through dates and categories to determine if and how the goal is met for each project. There were some troubles between organizing the data and creating tables with the use of certain filters for each column. The data also shows that the longer period of fundraising helped projects to be successful in meeting fundraiser goals. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When grouping the projects by Launch Date, the outcomes show us that the spring and summer seasons were best for beginning campaigns, regardless of year. Towards the peak of Spring in May, most projects were successful that were released during this time. Towards the end of the summer the trends show a decrease in goals met. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Using the goal for each project was another way to group the data. We were able to create range and see how projects did in that range. Most projects were successfully able to meet their fundraiser goal when the amount was under $1000. however afterwards we found a steady decline and with that, the failure rate would increase. Most projects with a goal of over 45000 seemed to fail as well.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Grouping the data was somewhat difficult as there was a lot of information provided ranging from launch date, to end date as well as many categories which included subcategories. There were many projects in the entertainment industry that are differentiated by many subcategories. A unexpected challenge was figuring out how to interpret the Linux timetag but was solved with changing the unit to short date. 
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The two conclusions to take away from the launch date is the time of year it is released and success rate. We see that the success rate climbs as the winter ends, prompting for more sucessful projects. However towards the end of the year the success rate is almost the same as the failure rate, giving it almost a one to one probability of reaching the goal or failing to. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The best outcome is attainable when the project has a goal that is not difficult to achieve. The higher the goal is, the more difficult it is to fundraise enough for it.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There were no limitations that I have come across. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some possibilities to determine trends in the data given would be to create a line plot to see what type of parent category is the most successful as well. We could also visualize the duration of projects because we are given their launch date and deadline. We would be able to see the trend in reaching goals compared to the amount of time a project has to do so.
